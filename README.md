# Architecture Diagram

## Description
1. **Raw Data Ingestion**: Raw data from devices (e.g., environmental metrics, particle analysis, and wiper performance data) is sent to Azure IoT Edge for local processing and anomaly detection. This ensures real-time data analysis at the edge before sending critical insights to the cloud.

2. **Local Anomaly Detection**: Azure IoT Edge forwards processed data to Local Anomaly Detection modules. Blob Storage temporarily stores raw or transformed data, while Azure ML processes it using pre-trained models deployed locally for real-time safety and anomaly detection.

3. **Data Forwarding to IoT Hub**: Azure IoT Edge sends selected data (e.g., anomalies, critical alerts, and aggregated metrics) to Azure IoT Hub for further processing, central monitoring, and cloud analytics.

4. **Real-Time Data Streaming**: IoT Hub streams real-time data to Azure Stream Analytics, which analyzes incoming data to identify anomalies, violations, or conditions requiring immediate attention.

5. **Batch Data Processing**: Batch data from Azure IoT Hub is transferred to Azure Data Factory for transformation and integration into the cold path for historical analysis and reporting.

6. **Device Provisioning**: The Device Provisioning Service ensures secure onboarding and configuration of IoT devices, enabling them to communicate with Azure IoT Hub.

7. **Triggering Machine Learning Models**: Real-time data insights from Azure Stream Analytics are used to trigger machine learning models for predictions, anomaly detection, or automated responses.

8. **Visualization and Reporting**: Insights generated by Azure Stream Analytics are sent to Power BI dashboards or exposed through APIs for visualization, reporting, or triggering actions in connected apps.

9. **Long-Term Storage**: Data Factory processes and ingests batch data into Azure Data Lake for long-term storage and further analysis.

10. **Data Processing with Spark**: Raw data stored in the Bronze Tier is processed using Spark Structured Streaming for downstream analytics and transformation into refined data tiers.

11. **Model Deployment to Edge**: Trained models are deployed back to Azure IoT Edge for local execution, enabling real-time safety and anomaly detection directly at the edge.

12. **Advanced Querying and Compliance**: Insights generated in Databricks SQL Analytics are sent to Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced querying, compliance reports, and integration into broader analytics systems.

13. **Interactive Reports and Dashboards**: Refined data from Silver/Gold tiers is sent to Power BI, API Management, or mobile/web apps for creating interactive reports, monitoring dashboards, or automated workflows.

14. **Secure Communication**: Azure Sphere ensures secure communication and operation of connected devices, providing encryption, device authentication, and tamper detection for IoT devices.

15. **Data Governance and Monitoring**:
    - **Azure Purview**: Ensures data governance and compliance for all data flows.
    - **Azure Monitor**: Tracks system performance and detects operational issues.
    - **Azure Key Vault**: Secures sensitive data such as API keys and credentials.

16. **Delivery of Insights**:
    - **Insights and Advanced Analytics**: Insights and advanced analytics from Azure Synapse Analytics are delivered to Power BI dashboards, API Management, or mobile and web apps for consumption by end-users, operators, and stakeholders.
    - **Examples of Data**: Examples of data passed include aggregated metrics, compliance reports, safety predictions, and operational trends.
